# Weather Dashboard Lite 🌦️

A simple weather app built with **React + TypeScript**.  
Users can search for any city and get real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API.  

## Features
- Async/await fetch with error handling
- Strong TypeScript typing (no `any`)
- Loading and error states
- Modern dark UI, responsive design

## Preview
Enter a city → press **Search** → see the weather 🌍🌡🌤

## Note
This is just one of my practice projects.
